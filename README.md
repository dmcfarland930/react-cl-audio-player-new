## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [CezarLuiz0.github.io/react-cl-audio-player](http://CezarLuiz0.github.io/react-cl-audio-player/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-cl-audio-player is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-cl-audio-player.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-cl-audio-player --save
```


## Usage

To use, just call the CLAudioPlayer instance and render it.

```
var CLAudioPlayer = require('react-cl-audio-player');

<CLAudioPlayer songs={songs} autoplay />
```

### Properties

* songs - An array with the object songs - required
* * url - string
* * cover - string - optional
* * artist - object
* * * name - string
* * * song - string
* autoplay - Is autoplay?

Songs model:

```
var songs = [
  {
    url: 'path/to/mp3',
    cover: 'path/to/jpeg',
    artist: {
      name: 'Metallica',
      song: 'Fuel'
    }
  },
  {
    url: 'path/to/your/mp3',
    artist: {
      name: 'X Japan',
      song: 'Art of Life'
    }

### Notes

Works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. No test in IE.


## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
